# ML_Project
* In this repo we will implement a predictive model where we will give the chances of having a heart disease for a given patient.
fisrt we use an **exploratory data analysis** to discover the features we're handling, then we will use predictive machine learning models (Random forest, Adaboost, XgBoost,...) along feature selection and concluding with voting classifer to select the best model with the best parameters
* We are finalizing our work by setting up a dashboard, powered by streamlit to summarize and automate the prediction process for health individuals specialized in data science.
